    /// User: dragging a session in the sidebar moves it between the Pinned, Sessions and Parked sections. A session dropped on another section's heading, or on any row of that section, of its own project gets that section's flags: Pinned pins it (and unparks it), Sessions unpins and unparks it, Parked parks it, which keeps a pinned session's pin so Unpark brings it back to Pinned. Supersedes the earlier rule that a session drag drew the headings of empty Pinned, Sessions and Parked sections so there was somewhere to drop: 2026-10-04 User: "when i start a drag on a session in the sidebar we're showing the other sections that aren't visible so i can drag to them which shifts things in the sidebar. i dont like this let's not do this please." Starting a drag never changes the sidebar's layout; only sections already drawn are drop targets. Supersedes the 2026-09-24 rule that the row then sits where the section's own order puts it, for Pinned: User: "When I drag a session between sessions into Pinned, it's not added to Pinned at the position I dropped it, and we don't show the drop line for it", so a drop on a pinned row pins it right there and a drop on the heading pins it last (gx-core `sidebar_drag/session_drop.rs`). Sessions and Parked keep their own order (Last Activity), and the drop line shows where that order puts the row.
