//! The body of an open disclosure: the vertical rail down its left and the
//! indent that hangs its content off that rail.
//!
//! React drew it with `SessionChatExpansion` (session-chat-expansion.tsx) and
//! the `.ghostex-chat-expansion*` rules in styles/chat.css (both deleted on
//! 2026-09-25): a two-pixel line in
//! `muted-foreground` at 42%, stretched over the whole body, with the content
//! starting a fixed distance to the right of it. Everything that opens onto
//! more rows uses it, so a reader can see at a glance which rows belong to the
//! heading they expanded: the turn's "Worked for Xs" log, a reasoning row's
//! detail and tool run, an expanded tool's arguments and result, and the
//! "+N previous tool calls" and "N tool calls" groups. Pressing the rail closes
//! the disclosure it belongs to, as React's `.ghostex-chat-expansion-rail`
//! button did.
