/// CDXC:SessionChat 2026-09-23 WHY:
/// gpui renders a notified view whole, and a view's redraw dirties its ancestors, so the working strip's pulse, the compaction bar, the composer tween and every spinner in the chat chrome re-laid out the whole transcript per frame; that is what kept the indicators throttled to seven frames per second and made them step.
/// The rows now live in this view, drawn cached inside the chat. Its own state stays on `NativeChatView`; this view only draws.
///
/// CDXC:SessionChat 2026-10-01 WHY:
/// Marking it for drawing again on every chat render (the 2026-09-23 rule) kept the rows cheap only while the chat itself drew rarely. The chat also draws when a view inside it is notified (the composer's caret blinks twice a second, every keystroke) and, in the GPUI web build, on every redraw of the page root that holds it uncached, so an open row thousands of pixels tall (an expanded "Worked for" group) was laid out whole two to six times a second while nothing changed, 7 to 16ms each time in the web build. It is now drawn again only when the chat itself was notified for the frame (`Window::view_was_notified`; everything the rows read from the chat changes behind a notify) or the composer's inset under the rows moved; scrolling, hover and anything inside the rows notify this view directly.
