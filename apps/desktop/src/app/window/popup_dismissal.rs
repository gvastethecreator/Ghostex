//! When a popup that closes on click-away (the new-thread picker, the chat's option menus,
//! Quick Access and the app modals that opt in through `close_app_modal_on_click_away`) has
//! really been dismissed. The other app modals never close on click-away (CDXC:AppModal
//! 2026-09-30 in app/window/modal_window_frame.rs).
//!
//! CDXC:AppModal 2026-09-30 WHY:
//! On Linux the window manager can move keyboard focus without a click: Hyprland (Omarchy's default) and other focus-follows-mouse setups focus the main window as soon as the pointer crosses onto it, so every popup that closed on focus loss closed when the mouse moved (Cmd+N's picker, the Saved Prompts Quick Access from a right-click, the chat's model menu, which flashed and vanished because the pointer is still over its trigger). Taking focus back fights the window manager on every pointer motion. So on Linux a focus loss dismisses a popup only once no Ghostex window holds focus (focus left the app), and a press in the main window after the popup opened is the click-away. macOS and Windows focus only on a click, so their focus loss stays the dismissal.

These modals call this: every Settings page kind (Settings, Hotkeys, Configure Agents, Configure Actions, Open Targets), Search by Prompt, the viewers above, Export Transcript once its export finished or failed, and the Agents Hub.

/// CDXC:AppModal 2026-10-08 WHY:
/// A dialog the modal opens itself (a file or folder picker, the system colour dialog, a confirm box, a UAC prompt) also takes focus from it, and must not count as a click away. So on macOS and Windows a focus loss closes the modal only when another Ghostex window took focus (the main window was clicked) or another app did; a window of this process that is not a GPUI window (the OS dialogs above) or no foreground window at all (the UAC secure desktop) keeps it open. Linux keeps the focus-follows-mouse rule above and closes only on a press in the main window, since its file pickers are portal dialogs in another process, indistinguishable from another app.
