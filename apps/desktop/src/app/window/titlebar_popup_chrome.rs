//! Native window chrome for the titlebar dropdown popup windows.
//!
//! The dropdown is an owned popup window that must never take activation from
//! the main window: the menus are mouse driven, Escape is handled by the main
//! window, and the main window's deactivation observer closes whichever
//! dropdown is open. A panel that steals activation therefore destroys itself
//! on the very click it was opened for.

/// CDXC:Titlebar 2026-09-20 WHY:
/// The Windows counterpart of the macOS `becomesKeyOnlyIfNeeded` panel. GPUI creates these popups with `focus: false`, which gives them WS_EX_NOACTIVATE and SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE, but its shared window procedure answers every WM_MOUSEACTIVATE with SetActiveWindow(handle) to keep `active_window` current. That activated the popup on the mouse-down before the click, deactivated the main window, and let the main window's observer close the popup before the click reached a row, so every titlebar dropdown row (Quick Actions "Configure" included) did nothing on Windows. Answering WM_MOUSEACTIVATE with MA_NOACTIVATE ahead of GPUI keeps the mouse message and leaves activation on the main window.

///
/// CDXC:Tooltips 2026-10-09 WHY:
/// The frosted tooltip host is a real window, and on Windows it caught the pointer when a tooltip opened under it: the floating files list read that as the pointer leaving and closed ("hovering over this tooltip in files list causing the floating files list to go away"), and the tooltip blocked clicks on the rows it covered. It answers hit tests with HTTRANSPARENT, which hands the pointer to the window beneath on the same thread (every GPUI window is on the main thread), as the macOS host's `ignoresMouseEvents` does.

/// CDXC:PlatformSupport 2026-10-04 WHY:
/// GPUI owns a Windows pop-up by whichever window is active when it opens, and keeps an unowned pop-up topmost. The chat's scroll-to-bottom pill (with its Escape and "Agent was interrupted" toasts) and the frosted tooltips can open while Ghostex is in the background (streaming text, a wheel or hover over the inactive window); they then had no owner and floated over the app the user had switched to. These overlays belong to the window they are drawn over, so they are owned by it and leave the topmost band, sitting just above it.
