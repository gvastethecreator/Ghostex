//! Follows the Workspaces built-in extension's switch (`crate::workspaces::workspaces_feature_enabled`)
//! so turning it on or off reaches every connected client within seconds: the team subscriptions
//! start or stop, a work-mode pass runs when it comes on, and every client gets one fresh
//! presentation snapshot (with or without the workspaces document, project workspace ids, work
//! mode and session work).
//!
//! CDXC:Workspaces 2026-10-09 WHY:
//! The switch lives in the settings file, which the desktop's Settings page and `ghostex settings`
//! write directly, so gxserver never hears of the write; it is read every few seconds like the
//! Spaces switch (`sidebar_spaces_switch.rs`). One full snapshot is sent instead of per-row deltas
//! because the switch changes every project row, every work-mode session and a side document at
//! once, and a snapshot is the one frame every client already applies wholesale.
