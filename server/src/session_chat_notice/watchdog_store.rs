Clean-screen retirement. A watchdog verdict about SCREEN state (the login
screen, the trust dialog, the crashed CLI, a queued input) is only true while
that screen is up, so the next capture that succeeds whole and classifies to
nothing is proof the state is over and the card must go. `deliveryFailed` is
deliberately exempt: it describes a message that was lost in the past, not
anything currently painted, so a clean screen says nothing about it and it keeps
its own retirement rules (the next send, a later verification, expiry).

Returns the notice that was retired, so a caller can tell whether a clearing
frame is owed; an already-expired entry was invisible to every reader and
therefore reports nothing.

A watchdog notice normally wins: it is both fresher and more specific than
whatever the screen classifier read at the same moment.

CDXC:SessionChat 2026-08-21: an ANSWERABLE screen notice is the
one exception, and it is not a close call. A watchdog notice reports a PAST
event ("your message could not be proven delivered") and its only advice is to
go look at the terminal; an answerable picker is the LIVE state that most
likely caused that event, and it can be resolved from the chat surface in one
click. Letting the past-event card mask it left the user staring at a
delivery-failed banner with the picker sitting unanswered on screen — the exact
dead end this feature exists to remove. `deliveryFailed` in particular is
exempt from clean-screen retirement, so it would have masked the picker for its
full 10-minute lifetime.

/// CDXC:AgentProviders 2026-09-07 DECISION:
/// After an account switch, hide the usage-limit message already shown for the previous login. Only a different message may appear; timestamps and repeated screen captures do not make it new.
/// CDXC:AgentProviders 2026-09-11 WHY:
/// The same wording is what the new login prints when it runs out too, so identity alone hid every later Fable limit on the account the session was switched to, and the switch pass never saw it.
/// The suppression therefore carries the switch time; `session_chat_notice_progress::refresh` lifts it when the transcript records a usage limit after that time, which is a new event, not a repaint.
/// Superseding the identity match of the same day: the resumed CLI repaints the old limit from its transcript with different glyphs and wording ("⏺ … esc or type to cancel" for the "⚠ … esc to cancel" spinner line), so an identity captured before the switch never matched the replay.
/// The card came back after the switch, blocked the composer with "Clear it in the terminal before sending", and held the continuation dot. The suppression is now by kind: every usage-limit notice stays hidden until the transcript proves a new limit.
