//! The offer a work-mode session gets once its linked PR is merged: remove its worktree and park
//! it, or keep it. The answer is stored on the session as `runtimeSettings.workCleanup`, keyed on
//! the PR, so the offer never comes back for that PR on any client.
//!
//! CDXC:WorkMode 2026-10-09 DECISION:
//! User: when a linked PR is merged, Ghostex offers to remove the worktree and park the session, not just put it to sleep. The offer is shown once per PR: after "Clean up" or "Keep" it does not come back for the same PR.
//!
//! CDXC:WorkMode 2026-10-09 WHY:
//! "Already offered" lives on the session in gxserver, not in a client, so the desktop, the web
//! build and the phone agree and an answer given on one is gone from the others.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: `/api/answerWorkCleanup` in server/src/server/route_http/work_links.rs (the answer),
//! apps/desktop/src/app/native_sidebar/work_chips.rs (the card's Clean up / Keep chips).
