//! Whether the Workspaces built-in extension is on for this machine (`workspacesHidden` on
//! Settings > Extensions). While it is off gxserver behaves as if workspaces and work mode did not
//! exist: work mode reads as off for every project (no refresh pass, no `gh` or Linear calls, no
//! `work` on sessions, no `workMode` on projects, no branch titles), the workspaces document and
//! the projects' workspace ids are not published (so every client shows every project, as a
//! daemon without workspaces does), the team subscriptions stop, added projects stay where they
//! are stored, and launches get no workspace Claude account. Nothing saved is touched.
