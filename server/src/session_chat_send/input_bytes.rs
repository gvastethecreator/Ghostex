Every C0 control except tab, line feed and carriage return, and DEL, is therefore written as its visible Control Pictures sign (U+2400 block, ␌ for a form feed), the rule ESC already followed: the agent still sees that something was there, and nothing in the text can act as a key. Applied where the send decides what the agent is handed (session_chat_queue_runtime/send.rs), so the paste check and the delivery watchdog compare the same text the terminal shows.

Agent composers reserve a final backslash followed by Return for inserting a
newline. Ghostex sends the body and Return as separate pty writes, so a prompt
whose final byte is `\\` otherwise triggers that shortcut instead of submitting.

Stage one terminal-only trailing space to disambiguate the Return. Supported
agent composers trim trailing whitespace when they submit, so the logical
prompt still ends in the user's backslash. Apply this at the shared terminal
encoding boundary so direct chat sends, queued sends, interactive free-text
answers, and generic submitted session messages all obey the same rule.
