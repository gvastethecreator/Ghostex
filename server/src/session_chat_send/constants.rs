Code's chunk-level paste handling inserts the burst bytes as literal text at
the head of the message instead of interpreting them as kill keys (observed
2026-08-23: a chat-sent prompt was recorded with 39×Ctrl-U + 39×Ctrl-K glued
to its front, which also left the optimistic echo unconsumed — the duplicated
user bubble). Same pacing discipline as the image settle and the separate

CDXC:Clipboard 2026-08-24:
Why the Enter is closed-loop. The old sequence wrote the paste body, slept
SESSION_CHAT_SUBMIT_DELAY_MS, then wrote a bare "\r" with nothing checking
that the composer had taken the body. Claude Code ingests a multi-KB paste
asynchronously — it paints "Pasting text…" and only later collapses the body
into a "[Pasted text #N +M lines]" placeholder — and under machine load that
ingestion takes LONGER than 500ms. Reproduced deterministically 2026-08-23
with a 69-line / 4.6KB message: the bare Enter submitted an EMPTY composer,
the body arrived afterwards, and the user's message was silently lost because
it remained stranded in the terminal composer. zmx transport was byte-perfect
at that size, so the race is purely TUI ingestion time versus a fixed delay.

The fix is to watch the screen instead of the clock: settle briefly (so a
paste that already landed costs no extra latency), then poll captures until
the body is provably on screen. A send whose body cannot be proven present is
ABORTED without an Enter — losing the send with an error the user sees is
strictly better than submitting an empty turn and dropping their text.
