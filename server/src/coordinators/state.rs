/// CDXC:Coordinators 2026-10-06 WHY:
/// Empryo has no hook for a question or an approval: the PreToolUse of the tool that asks leaves its hooks at working while its choice panel waits, so its thread never showed as waiting. The supervisor records what the chat's cached screen reading shows for every running thread each tick, and every surface (its reports, the Threads panel, `ghostex coordinator status`, the sidebar's crew count) classifies from that record. While hooks say working only a question or a permission prompt counts (Claude's own permission prompt moves its hooks to attention, so Claude and Codex threads read as before); any other blocking screen counts once hooks stop saying working. The record is rebuilt from the cache every tick, and the cache is re-read when the screen changes and after an answer, so an answered question leaves with the next tick.
