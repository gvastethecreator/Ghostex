//! The send path: `send`, `queue`, `compact`, `handoff`, `receiveHandoff`, `interrupt`, `sendKey`.
//!
//! Port of the `send`/`queue`/`compact`, `handoff`, `receiveHandoff`, `interrupt` and `sendKey`
//! arms of `packages/shared/session-chat-controller/native-host.ts`, of
//! `deliverChatSubmission` (`submission.ts`), `sendSessionChatOptionAware` (`option-command.ts`)
//! and of the `send`, `sendKey`, `queuePrompt`, `pushDraft` and `interrupt` callbacks in
//! `controller.ts`.
//!
//! **The shape.** The TypeScript arm awaits five or six things in a row and its closing
//! `publish(controller.current())` runs after the last of them. The core cannot await, so the
//! same order is a list of [`SendPhase`]s on [`Submission`], one answer at a time: the head phase
//! is in flight, its answer runs the next one, and the arm's publish lands when the list empties
//! (`CoreState::publish_awaits`).
//!
//! **What stays with family a.** The optimistic echo, the "Ran /x" marker, the keystroke marker
//! and the Stop suppression are the pending matcher's rules, so this file calls
//! `crate::session::sends` for every one of them and never writes `state.pending` itself.
//!
//! **What stays with the host.** `draftSubmitted`, `submissionFailed` and `draftReceived` are the
//! composer field's own bookkeeping (`docs/2026-09-21/rust-chat/HOST-TODO.md` section 2), and the
//! handoff id is a `crypto.randomUUID()` the core has no source for. All three ride out as
//! [`Effect::HostAction`].
