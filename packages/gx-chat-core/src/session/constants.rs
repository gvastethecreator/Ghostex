/// CDXC:SessionChat 2026-10-08 DECISION:
/// User: "please make these messages easier to understand and also please make it keep retrying every 2 seconds itself until gx server is there instead of just requiring the user to click". A read that got no answer is retried every 2 seconds, one read in flight at a time, with no limit while the chat is open: the 60 s seed window and the resync backoff only apply to refusals. Then, on the chat: "i dont like Loading this conversation in the state that gxserver isn't ready basically let's just show the skeleton in that state with the normal chat composer shown". So while the service is not answering the transcript shows the skeleton rows (`transcriptSkeleton`), with no text and no Try now, the composer stays as usual, and the conversation fills in silently when the service answers. Only a refusal that ends in an error gets a sentence and a button.
