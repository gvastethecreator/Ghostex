//! Family e2's state: the model picker, the model menu, model selection, model favorites, the

//!
//! **This file belongs to family e2.** Family e1 owns `state/menus.rs` and the rest of
//! `src/menus/`; e2 owns `src/menus/picker/` and `src/menus/context/` and this struct. No other
//! family edits it.
//!
//! Read from, never write to: `ChatState::session::selected_options` (family a merges it by
//! evidence priority and `detectedAt`), `ChatState::session::pending_model_selection`,
//! `ChatState::session::available_agents`, `ChatState::session::agent_session_id`,
//! `ChatState::core::title` and `ChatState::core::hide_account_emails`.
