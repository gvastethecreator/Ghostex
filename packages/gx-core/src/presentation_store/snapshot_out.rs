//! The reverse of a snapshot: the rows a machine holds, written back out as one
//! `PresentationSnapshot`.
//!
//! CDXC:RemoteMachines 2026-09-21 WHY:
//! The last-seen copy of an offline remote machine is stored as a whole
//! `GxserverPresentationSnapshot`, the same shape the stream delivers, so the store has to be able
//! to hand one back. That is a decoding question rather than a serializing one: the value the old
//! sidebar writes is what the old sidebar reads, and both are still live, so a copy that dropped a
//! field or reordered an array would be a different payload for the same key and the two writers
//! would flip the row between them on every publish.
//!
//! **What makes the two bytewise equal is the ARRAY ORDER, and it is the daemon's own.** Projects
//! and groups keep the `(sortKey, id)` order [`super::loaded`] already sorts them into; sessions
//! are written in `(projectId, groupId, sortKey, sessionId)` order, which is the key sequence
//! `orderPresentationSessions` (`packages/shared/gxserver-presentation-cache.ts`) re-sorts the
//! TypeScript cache into after every delta. Byte order rather than `localeCompare`, for the reason
//! on `sort_projects`: the daemon orders by byte order and the store follows the daemon.
//!
//! **What is NOT written, on purpose.** The local overlays (a pending sleep, a local hide, a
//! manual reorder's predicted row) are this client's guesses about a machine, not the machine, and
//! a copy read back next run must start from what the daemon said. Rows a snapshot could not parse
//! (`Rows::skipped`) are not written back either: the store does not hold them.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/remote_last_seen.rs (the only caller today),
//! packages/gx-core/src/presentation_store/apply.rs (`seed_last_seen`, which reads one back in).
