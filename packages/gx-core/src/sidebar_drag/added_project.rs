//! Where a project the Add Project dialog just added lands.
//!
//! CDXC:Spaces 2026-09-15 DECISION:
//! User: a project added through the Add Project dialog joins the Space that is open in the sidebar
//! and goes to the top of it. Two writes, and they happen at different moments: the MEMBERSHIP is
//! written the instant the dialog reports the project, because the reveal that follows the
//! activation resolves the project's Space and must find it there; the ORDER can only be written
//! once the daemon has listed the project and the sidebar has a group for it, which is one or more
//! snapshots later, so the host holds the project id until then.
//!
//! The membership is written only when the open view is a real Space (never the built-in Other,
//! which claims nothing) and only when the project is not already shown by it: a project the Space
//! already inherits through its Project Group is left alone rather than pinned to the Space
//! directly, which would survive the group moving out of it.
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: the deleted sidebar page's `events.ts`,
//! packages/core-ui/spaces.ts (deleted 2026-10-01) (`addSpaceProjectMember`),
//! packages/core-ui/sidebar-app/drag-drop-geometry.ts (deleted 2026-10-01) (`moveProjectGroupFamilyToStart`),
//! apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/added_project.rs.
