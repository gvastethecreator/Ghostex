//! What a Space switch restores the focus to.
//!
//! CDXC:Spaces 2026-09-21 DECISION:
//! User: switching to a Space reopens the session that Space was last left on, in the view its
//! project was in (`sidebarSpaceSwitchBehavior: restore`, the default). The MEMORY of that session
//! is written on every focus change and every reveal (`sidebar_ui/store.rs`,
//! `RememberSpaceSession`); this is the other half, the read, and it runs only when the switch
//! actually changes the selected Space.
//!
//! **Declared difference from `switchNativeSidebarSpace`.** The rows are taken from the list the
//! sidebar DRAWS for the newly selected Space, where the TypeScript takes `state.groupOrder`
//! filtered by the Space alone. So a project the user HID, a row a tag filter removed, and the
//! machine's Chats collection are not restore targets here, and the first of those three is the
//! only one that can change what a user sees: the TypeScript could focus a session inside a project
//! the sidebar is not showing. The same "the rows the list draws" rule already decides
//! `collectionAction:select` and `sidebarAction:toggleProjects`.
//!
//! Ported from the sidebar page's Space navigation (frozen in the deleted
//! `tooling/gx-core/sidebar-page-frozen/space-navigation.ts`; see git history).
//!
//! SEE-ALSO: apps/desktop/src/app/gx_store/space_switch.rs.
